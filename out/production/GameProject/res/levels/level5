BASIC ZAGGER SHIELDED
Irridum9 is the strangest planet in this galaxy. It has a population of 50million, has no materials except some old,
almost empty coal mines. The population is starving and living a hard life, but the defense seems pretty strong.
Nobody knows how they achieved to get such a space army, but some say that the planet is protected by a stronger force,
but why would anybody protect such a poor planet?
